# OOMMF permalloy thin film simulation

The micromagnetic platform OOMMF was used to simulate the time evolution of a square thin film of permalloy $Ni_{80}Fe_{20}$ at finite temperature (width and height = $3$ $\mu\text{m}$, thickness = $2$ nm). The minimum uniaxial anisotropy constant $K_1=330\text{ kJ/m}^3$ which guaranteed an out-of-plane remanent magnetization (starting from an out-of-plane configuration of the magnetic moments) was found with a precision of $5\text{ kJ/m}^3$. Upon implementing the Dzyaloshinskiiâ€“Moriya interaction in the simulations, the evolution of the sample starting from a two-domain configuration was studied. The value of the DMI constant $D$ determined the speed and the extent of the domain wall propagation during the simulations. Finally, several ways to evaluate the anisotropic magnetoresistance of the formed domain walls were discussed.
